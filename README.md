# SoftwareE_project
### Intro
- We have developed a prototype based on the requirements of our client, an application which supports the scheduling process for a company.
- Essentially expert trainers are assigned to teach a specific course on a weekly basis.
- These courses are made readily available for consultants based on the category they fall into (e.g. Graduates, Returners to Work, Ex-forces)
